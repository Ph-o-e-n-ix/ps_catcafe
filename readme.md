Hey Guys.
as far as I know, many people have the Gabz subscription and therefore also have the Cat Cafe. It was a bit boring outside, so I made a few improvements. 
I hope you enjoy it.
This is not a big deal, but i want to share it with you. Heres is the Cat Cafe, because without the Map it would be wrong :D ->[GABZ CAT CAFE MLO](https://fivem.gabzv.com/package/4724734)

Please follow the Step to make sure, that you install the map correctly.

1. Take the File from uwuexterior/denis3d_catcafe_exterior.ymap
2. Go into the cfx-gabz-catcafe Folder from Gabz to cfx-gabz-catcafe/stream/ymap
3. Replace the denis3d_catcafe_exterior.ymap with my custom denis3d_catcafe_exterior.ymap
